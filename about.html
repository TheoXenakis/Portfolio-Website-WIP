                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        I'm a game designer, programmer, and world-builder. Whether it's scripting complex systems, crafting immersive levels, or shaping game-feel through mechanics, I love bringing interactive ideas to life. My journey began with childhood curiosity about how my favorite games worked and has grown into a dedicated pursuit of design that balances logic and creativity.
                        <br><br>
                        My core interest lies in creating games that are expressive, whether through playstyle, mechanics, or narrative. I thrive on collaboration, experimentation, and thoughtful iteration. Outside of game dev, I love analyzing systems in games, studying visual design trends, and trying to make cool stuff with cool people.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of game development, I love bodybuilding and martial arts. Beginning at five years old, I joined a taekwondo studio where I spent thirteen years training. During high school, I decided to delve further into the sport by competing, coaching younger students, and working as an instructor for the studio. Eventually I reached my third degree black-belt. The entire process instilled unrelenting discipline and a continued desire for fitness. The lessons learned in my years practicing Taekwondo are invaluable and have become assets with which I apply to everything I do.

            <h2>Games That Inspired Me</h2>
            <p>Throughout my journey as a game designer, several titles have shaped my understanding of what makes games truly memorable and engaging. Here are a few that left a lasting impact:</p>
